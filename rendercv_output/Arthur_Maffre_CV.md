# Research Projects

## [Meta-FlowNet](#)

- Mar 2025 – present
- Designed a **novel** architecture combining **GFlowNets** with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (**PINNs**)
- Modeled the generation of CDF-like **structures** from reward-flow **trajectories** over continuous parameters
- Introduced adaptive sampling and active learning mechanisms to boost **efficiency** in hard regions
- Application: **dynamic portfolio** sequencing, stochastic optimization

## [Bilevel Pricing with GFlowNet](#)

- Mar 2025 – present
- Using a formulated a bilevel pricing model where consumers solve a knapsack problem to maximize utility
- Used GFlowNets with **Critic** to simulate consumer response and improve leader pricing strategy
- Integrated mixed-integer programming with generative flow dynamics

## [Transformer-GFlowNet for Sequential Portfolio Optimization](#)

- June 2024 – present
- Developed a **Transformer-based** model to generate vectors of asset allocations
- Modeled transaction costs, turnover constraints, and **dynamic Sharpe** ratio optimization
- Used **MCMC**-based simulation for sequence interpretability and **XMAP** evaluation
